		<p><h2><font color = "#FFFFFF">What is Lorem Ipsum?</p></h2>
<p><b><i>Lorem Ipsum</b></i><sup>[1]</sup> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, <br> but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p><h2>Why do we use it?</p></h2>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br> The point of using <strong><em>Lorem Ipsum</strong></em><sup>[2]</sup> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', <br> making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, <br> and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
